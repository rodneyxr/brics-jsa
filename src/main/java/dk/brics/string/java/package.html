Translating Jimple code into intermediate representation.
<p>
    Intermediate representation (IR) is simplified compared to the Jimple code in the following ways:
<ul>
    <li>Only variables of type <code>String</code>, <code>StringBuffer</code>,
        <code>StringBuilder</code> or array (of any dimension) of
        <code>String</code> are retained. Only operations on these types occur in the IR.
        Variables declared as a supertype of one of those, such as <code>Object</code> or <code>Serializable</code>,
        are also retained.
    <li>All control constructs are abstracted away. Remaining is a conservative control flow graph of IR statements.
        The graph includes edges corresponding to exception control flow.
    <li>Each method invocation has exactly one possible target. For virtual invocations, the control-flow is split
    	and a separate invocation is created for each possible target, defined by Soot's Class-Hierarchy analysis.
    <li>Operations on the string types are translated into appropriate function symbols
        depending on the non-string arguments to the operation. A constant
        analysis is used to infer the values of these arguments whereever possible in
        order to produce a precise approximation.
    <li>Conversions from primitive types to string are modeled by a regular set describing
        the possible string values that such a conversion can result in.
    <li>Implicit conversions from reference types to string are translated into a call
        to the appropriate toString method. If the intra-procedural nullness analysis provided by Soot
        determines that the converted value might be null, the string "<code>null</code>" is added as an extra
        possibility.
    <li>Any value that could originate from outside the known program is modeled
        as the set of all strings. If a <code>StringBuffer</code>, <code>StringBuilder</code>,
        or <code>String</code> array value escapes into
        unknown code, it is marked as escaping at that point in the program by a
        special escape construct in the IR.
</ul>
